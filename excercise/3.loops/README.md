<h1>LOOPS</h1>
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
<ul>
     <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
     <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
     <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
     <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
     <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
</ul>
