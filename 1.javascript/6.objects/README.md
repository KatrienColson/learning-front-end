Warm up

Before we dive into the world of objects, do some research for the keywords below.
Keywords

    JSON
    Constructor
    this. js
    new operator js
    Object methods
    Custom methods

Note: Create a section for each exercise.
Exercise 1

Tell us a little more about yourself in this exercise. Create an object named 'aboutMe'.

Create the following properties:

    Name
    Age
    Gender
    Favorite food
    Favorite series
    Favorite movies
    Single

Display all the object keys and values in a html file as a list.

Now Imagine we have to create objects for your whole family... That is a lot of work for such a small result.
Good news! We don't have to do this!
Exercise 2

Create a constructor named "FamilyMember". By using this method, create 3 objects:

    Father
    Mother
    Brother/Sister

Exercise 3

For this exercise, create a card for each family member. In this card we can find an image of the family member and a list of info about him/her. There should be a button located in each card.

Now let's create a method inside the constructor. This should do the following:

    Register when the button has been pressed. (console.log)
    Toggle the displayed images on/off (one at a time!).

Exercise 4

GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL! That's right our Pokémon app is back! In our previous Pokémon exercise, we used pre-written variables. Now with your JSON knowledge, transform these properties into an object named pokémon.

In this object there should be 2 methods that will:

    Show only 2 random moves from the array.
    Display a small paragraph about the selected pokemon with the collected data. (Example: This is Pikachu. Pikachu uses thunderbolt, iron-tail as moves and has a total weight of 60.)

plus 6 properties :

    Name
    Id
    Moves
    Abilities
    Image
    Weight

Make sure the app still works!
