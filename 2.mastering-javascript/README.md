Rules

Read the rules first before continuing to the instructions!

For this exercise a few extra rules apply:

    No asking help from your fellow juniors
    All questions go to google
    If you're stuck you come straight to your coaches
    We will have Ryver open at all times during this exercise, send us a pm and we will come to you (that way you can stay seated smile )
    Whenever you're stuck on logic, you are allowed to use the whiteboard and do an explanation in group (this is the only way you are allowed to help each other)
