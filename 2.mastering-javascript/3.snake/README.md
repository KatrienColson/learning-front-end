Exercise

Make a web page that allows you to play the game "Snakes". Realize this using the HTML5 canvas element.
Requirements
Practical

    HTML5 canvas that renders the game;
    Button that allows you to start the game;
    Score field that keeps track of the score;
    The snake is controlled through the arrow keys;
    Make sure the code is commented properly.
    This page MUST be styled nicely!

Game related / rules

    The snake is always moving while the game is going on;
    When the snake collides with itself, the game is over;
    When the snake collides with a wall (read: canvas border), the snake needs to come out on the other side;
    There is always a piece of food on the field;
    Whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in size by 1, and the player's score increases.

Additional features

    Allow the player to choose the color of the snake;
    Make it so the snake's head has an opacity of 1 and it gradually decreases towards the snake's tail;
    Whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it needs to start moving a little bit faster;
    Keep track of the high score in case multiple games are played, and display this high score on the web page.
    Do the above linked to a username (no login required), let the user select a username when the page is loaded.
    Display the highscore of the current user as well as the top three user's scores ever

Bonus objectives

    Make a difficulty selector, the harder the difficulty, the higher the base speed and the incremental steps
    Allow the user to select a background and / or a soundtrack to play on
    When the user loses, display "Game over", after a couple of seconds, display "Insert coin" (or anything similar if you want to use your creativity wink )

Getting started

To get started on making snake, I recommend using the following tutorial. NO COPY PASTA!
Goals

    Learning to code DRY. (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    Learning to read someone else's code and change it.
    Showing you understand code by writing comments.
